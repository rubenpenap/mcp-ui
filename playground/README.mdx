# Send Prompts

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicai.pro/workshops/day-5-6-mcp-ui/prompts-m0qlk" />

👨‍💼 Our users expect the "Summarize" button to instantly craft a short, insightful take on the entry they're viewing. To make that happen, the UI needs to send a natural-language prompt to the host via our MCP bridge, then show the result without a page reload. If we don't deliver, people lose trust and the feature feels broken.

Here's the pattern you'll use from components:

```ts
// Send a prompt message to the host
await sendMcpMessage('prompt', {
	prompt:
		'Please ask CafeLedger get_balance for account espresso-ops and summarize the budget health.',
})
```

What you need to build:

- Add a new `'prompt'` message type to `app/utils/mcp.ts` so the bridge can validate payloads.
- Add a function overload for `sendMcpMessage('prompt', payload, options)` that mirrors the `'link'` overload but accepts `{ prompt: string }`.
- In the summarize button component, call `sendMcpMessage('prompt', { prompt })`.

👨‍💼 Let's wire up the prompt path so pressing "Summarize" works.
