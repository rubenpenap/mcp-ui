👨‍💼 When users view their journal entries, they expect the interface to be sized appropriately for comfortable reading. A cramped window makes it hard to read entries, while an oversized frame wastes screen space.

Add `uiMetadata` with `preferred-frame-size` to specify the ideal dimensions for the journal viewer:

```ts
uiMetadata: {
	// width and height in pixels
  'preferred-frame-size': ['400px', '600px'],
}
```

The `preferred-frame-size` key accepts an array with width and height values. The UI system will try to respect your preferred size based on available screen space.

Now, add the `uiMetadata` to make the journal viewer shine.
