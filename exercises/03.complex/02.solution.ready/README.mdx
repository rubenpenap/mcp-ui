👨‍💼 Great work! We've successfully solved a critical communication problem for our users: now when iframes load in AI chat, they immediately tell the host application they're ready to receive data and handle interactions. This eliminates broken interfaces and endless loading states that frustrated users before.

This improvement means users get smooth, responsive experiences where embedded applications feel integrated with the host application from the moment they load. The handshake ensures data flows properly and interactions work reliably.

Let's keep going to make the experience even better!
