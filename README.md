## Prerequisites

- JavaScript/TypeScript experience
- Node.js experience
- [Advanced MCP Features](https://www.epicai.pro/advanced-mcp-features) or
  equivalent experience.

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [Letting AI Interface with Your App with MCPs](https://www.epicai.pro/letting-ai-interface-with-your-app-with-mcps-talk)
- [MCP Introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
- [Your AI Assistant Instructor: The EpicShop MCP Server](https://www.epicai.pro/your-ai-assistant-instructor-the-epicshop-mcp-server-0eazr)
- [How to Debug Your MCP Server](https://www.epicai.pro/how-to-debug-your-mcp-server-38qyl)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v18 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

> **Warning**: This repo is _very_ large. Make sure you have a good internet
> connection before you start the setup process. The instructions below use
> `--depth` to limit the amount you download, but if you have a slow connection,
> or you pay for bandwidth, you may want to find a place with a better
> connection.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/mcp-ui.git
cd mcp-ui
npm run setup
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.
